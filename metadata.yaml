description: Born in Russia to British parents, Fred Whishaw's family returned to
  England soon after his birth. However, at age 16, Whishaw decided to reacquaint
  himself with his country of origin and struck out for St. Petersburg on his own.

  Moscow is a fictionalized account of the French incursion into Russia in 1812...
